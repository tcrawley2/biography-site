                <p>
                    Ever since I was young my dream was to play professional
                    sports. It didn't matter what sport it was, I was determined
                    to make it to the pros.
                </p>
                <p>The list of sports I played growing up consist of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Football: 11 years</li>
                    <li>Baseball: 10 years</li>
                    <li>Basketball: 6 years</li>
                    <li>Track: 2 years</li>
                    <li>Soccer: 1 year</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In high school, however, I gravitated to playing football,
                    earning All-State honors and playing in 2 state
                    championships. In college, I went from being a Walk-On bench
                    player, to a starting wide receiver, a senior captain, and
                    ultimately an invitee to an NFL Rookie Mini-Camp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless of the sport, I truly believe that my involvement
                    in sports helped me become a better student, as well as a
                    better employee in the professional setting.

                            The ability to work cohesively with others is a key
                            part of playing team sports. A team's ability to
                            mesh is directly correlated to their success. At a
                            young age, I learned how to be a good leader, how to
                            encourage and motivate others. Being open to
                            criticism from your peers is also a key component of
                            teamwork. Being able to identify individual
                            strengths and synergies among the team members is
                            also crucial for team success.

                            No one likes to fail, but building the strength and
                            the courage to keep trying, while understanding the
                            possibility of future failure, is
                            <strong>crucial</strong> for learning a new skill,
                            on or off the field. As a professor of mine says,
                            "in order to learn, you must have to suffer a little
                            bit."

                        <td>
                            I love competition and what you can learn from
                            yourself in those situations. Being able to compete,
                            both with yourself and with others, will push the
                            boundaries of your performance. Knowing how to keep
                            competition healthy is important, since it can be
                            easy to be discouraged when you lose. But being a
                            competitor is extremely important in many aspects of
                            life.

                    affect on my life. If you're interested, feel free to check
