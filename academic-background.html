                    At an early age, my parents made it very clear that
                    academics came first. If I wanted to play videogames, I had
                    to make sure all of my homework was completed. Whenever I
                    wanted to hang out with my friends, I had to make sure that
                    I read for at least an hour before. If I EVER wanted to play
                    on an organized sports team, I had to have good grades.

                    In high school, I attended Bellarmine College Preparatory, a
                    high school in San Jose that is probably known better for
                    its Speech and Debate and Robotics teams than for its sports
                    teams (which is saying something). To this day, my 4 years
                    of high school was the toughest experience of education I've
                    ever gone through.

                            You may not know the answers to every question, but
                            the ability to know who to ask and where to look is
                            an important part of school, as well as in life.
                            Utilizing resources available is an essential skill
                            to learn.

                            When you have multiple classes with different
                            deadlines for homework, projects, and exams,
                            managing your time well will set you up for success.
                            Planning out your month, week, or even day will keep
                            you organized and reinforce structure amidst chaos.

                            One of the most invaluable skills I've learned in
                            school is how to interact with other people. Whether
                            you're in a team for a class project, or even when
                            you're in a fairly heated debate with another
                            classmate, being able to effectively communicate
                            your thoughts and ideas, while listening and
                            respecting the thoughts and ideas of others, is very
                            important.

                    Although I wasn't the best student, I believe that the
                    skills I mentioned above has and continues to maximize my
                    success, both in and out of the classroom. I don't have a
                    highlight video for any academic achievements, however I do
                    have two pretty cool pictures with Archie and Peyton
                    Manning, at the 2017 NFF National Scholar-Athlete Awards
                    ceremony in New York.
